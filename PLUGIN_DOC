This document describes most of the aspects people need to know in order to write a plugin for this IRC bot.

The bot will search for plugins.<name> and try to instanciate a class of type Plugin()
this plugin can have three diffrent function that is called. These are:

- cmd (for commands like !kick)
- listen (to get everything said in a channel)
- help (so you can inform people of your commands)
       Syntax of help is ?<cmd>
       ?all should list all of the available commands in your Plugin

Information available in kwargs:

- from_nick: The nick of the sender of this message/command
- from_ident: The ident from the hostmask of the sender of this message/command
- from_host_mask: The adress the sender has.
- auth_nick: If a user is logged in, this will be his account name. None if the Auth System is turned
             off or the person is not logged in.
- auth_level: an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 is the owner and 0 is just a user. Who is what
              and at what level distinqushes what, is up for debate.
- channel_users: The list of users in the channel that the current message/command is comming from.
- nick_to_user: A dictionary that contains the Username in the Authentication system as value and
                current nick on IRC as key. This will contain the nick if the user is online.
- user_to_nick: same as above, only reversed key and value. This has a lazy evaluation, so it will
                not delete a user even if he goes online. But will reset if the user changes nick

Return values:

To send messages or notifies to a channel, you have to return it. It should be in the form of 
a list with touples, where each touple must contain the following:

(0, channel, message) // Same as send message to channel.
(0, channel, nick, message) // Same as above but will be prefixed witht the nick e.g Bob: <message>
(1, channel, message) // Notify in a channel (if channel == user, the user will be notified)

So return values would be e.g:

[(0, "#iskbot", "Nothing more to do here")]

will give channel message:
Bot: Nothing more to do here



[(0, "#iskbot", "Bob is being mean")
(1, "Bob", "This is a warning for bad behaviour")]

will give channel message:
Bot: Bob is being mean
and notification to Bob:
-Notice- This is a warning for bad behaviour
